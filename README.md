# CS-327-Compilers

You can use these materials to get started for building your own compiler.
Two sample language processors (source code + binary) designed by me are available here.
- **Pro** (```pro```): Scanner, Parser, Analyzer of sentences expressed in Propositional Logic.
- **language_processor** (```sm```): Scanner, Parser, Analyzer of sentences expressing arithmetic operations in ```bash```.
